# DecisiveStrikeTimer

This is a super simple timer which gives an audio cue when the Decisive Strike runs out in Dead By Daylight (60 seconds).  
More information on Decisive Strike here : https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Decisive_Strike  

## Install  

*If you have a Python3 environment, just pull this code and run with right dependencies.*  
Download from the release, run **Timer.exe** and leave it in the background.  

## Usage  

While running, press **Page Up** to activate the timer. After 60 seconds, you will hear the Windows Default Sound.  
You can keep using the timer as long as the program is active, but currently you can't use it again while the timer is already in use.  
To quit, press **Page Down**.  

## Update  

Because this program is very primitive, from this point and on, it will continute to evolve.  
The priority is to come up with a GUI, then support for multiple-simultaneous Decisive Strikes.
