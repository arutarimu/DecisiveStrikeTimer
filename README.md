# DecisiveStrikeTimer

This is a super simple timer which gives an audio cue when the Decisive Strike runs out (60 seconds).  

## Install  

*If you have a Python3 environment, just pull this code and run with right dependencies.*  
Download from the release, run **Timer.exe** and leave it in the background.  

## Usage  

While running, press **Page Up** to activate the timer. After 60 seconds, you will hear the Windows Default Sound.  
You can keep using the timer as long as the program is active, but currently you can't use it again while the timer is already in use.  
To quit, press **Page Down**.
